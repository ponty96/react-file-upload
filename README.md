### Linting

This boilerplate project includes React-friendly ESLint configuration.

```
npm run lint
```

### Using `0.0.0.0` as Host

You may want to change the host in `server.js` and `webpack.config.js` from `localhost` to `0.0.0.0` to allow access from same WiFi network. This is not enabled by default because it is reported to cause problems on Windows. This may also be useful if you're using a VM.


### Dependencies
